/* This is just a placeholder to differentiate the test cases for the evaluation.
 * The following 5 test cases performed better when all Int Domains ("def_exc",...,"congruence") are activated.
 * Test 33 to 37 use "exp.annotated.precision" to get better results than the original Tests,
 * with the least amount of active Int Domains per function,
 * e.g. Test 41/33-01_03-loops_i.c performes as 01/03-loops.c would when all Int Domains are activated.
