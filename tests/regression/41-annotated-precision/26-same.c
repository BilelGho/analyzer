/* This is just a placeholder to differentiate the test cases for the evaluation.
 * The following 5 test cases performed better when all Int Domains ("def_exc",...,"congruence") are activated.
 * Test 27 to 31 use "exp.annotated.precision" to get the same result as the original Tests,
 * e.g. Test 41/27-01_03-loops.c performes as 01/03-loops.c would.
